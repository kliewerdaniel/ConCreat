    "prompt": "A surreal, high‑contrast illustration of a charismatic cult leader standing at the centre of an otherworldly laboratory. The leader is cloaked in flowing robes that ripple like liquid mercury, eyes glowing with an inner phosphorescent light. Around him, ten women of diverse ages and ethnicities form a semi‑circular ring; each woman wears ethereal, iridescent garments that blend into the surrounding environment—silks that shimmer with rainbow sheens, delicate feathered accessories, and subtle bioluminescent tattoos that pulse in time with their breath.  \n\nIn front of the leader sits a massive, ornate glass cauldron filled with swirling, neon‑colored liquid that resembles molten amethyst mixed with electric teal. The potion inside bubbles with fractal patterns—tiny spirals and Mandelbrot‑style edges—that expand outward like living ribbons of light. Wisps of vapor rise from the brew, forming translucent arches that curl around the women’s wrists and ankles, hinting at an invisible binding spell.  \n\nBehind this central tableau a thick, opalescent fog rolls across the floor, coalescing into ghostly tendrils that lift upward. Within this mist a newborn infant emerges, cradled by a halo of soft white light. The baby’s form is fragmented—its limbs appear as overlapping silhouettes of embryonic cells, DNA helices, and stylized bone structures—symbolizing themes of eugenic experimentation and biological disintegration. Tiny glints of metallic gold trace the contours of its tiny heart, suggesting both fragility and an uncanny resilience.  \n\nThe entire scene is rendered in a psychedelic art style: vibrant, saturated colors that clash and blend (electric magenta, acid green, deep indigo), thick black outlines reminiscent of 1960s poster art, and intricate fractal motifs woven into the background walls—geometric lattices, repeating mandalas, and spiraling vines that seem to pulse with kinetic energy. Light sources are multiple: a phosphorescent chandelier of crystalline shards casting prismatic beams, neon tubes embedded in the lab’s metallic surfaces, and the soft glow emanating from the baby itself.  \n\nThe perspective is slightly low‑angle, emphasizing the towering cauldron and the looming figure of the cult leader while still allowing a clear view of the infant emerging from the fog. Depth of field is shallow around the central figures but deep enough to keep every fractal detail crisp—from the fine filaments of the potion’s swirls to the delicate pattern on each woman's garment.  \n\nOverall mood: surreal, hypnotic, and slightly unsettling—a visual meditation on control, transformation, and the fragile boundaries between creation and destruction.",

    "prompt": "*\"A hyper-stylized, whimsical cartoon depicting a sentient, 3D-printed pineapple that has somehow become a tiny, rebellious CEO of a floating island paradise. The pineapple wears a tiny, crooked business suit made from coconut husks, complete with a suspiciously fake gold chain, and a tiny monocle (also made from a seashell). It holds a tiny, overpriced espresso cup labeled ‘“COFFEE” (INSULIN-FREE)’ and a clipboard filled with handwritten notes in a mix of Pinyin and abstract hieroglyphs. The floating island has palm trees that grow upside-down due to ‘anti-gravity startups,’ and a sign on the fence reads: “OFFLIMITS: NO TARIFFS ON JOY.” The whole scene is rendered in a mix of warm retro-futurism (like a 1992 Pixar short) and vibrant, slightly chaotic modern digital art. Soft pastel lighting with neon blue shadows, ultra-detailed textures, and a dreamy, surreal aesthetic.\"*\n",
    "negativePrompt": "*\"Blurry, low-resolution, distorted faces, overly generic stock photos, medical-looking ‘insulin’ pills instead of coffee, overly serious expressions, no weirdly shaped palm trees, no corporate office vibes, no overly detailed business attire, no glitch art, no pixelated effects, no overly literal interpretations, no ‘dark academia’ or ‘grunge’ aesthetics, no obvious copyrighted logos or trademarks, no overly sad or cartoonish smiles, no ‘cute but still realistic’ proportions, no overly corporate or bureaucratic visuals.\"*\n",
